# Project Description: 
Using SQL, Python, and Google Looker Studio, this project analyzes sales data from a retail business to produce powerful visualizations and actionable insights.  The dataset includes several tables that represent customers, orders, goods, and payments: customer_detail, order_detail, sku_detail, and payment_detail.  

# Project's Goals:
1. Gaining important insights: determining best-selling items, examining trends by category, and enhancing decision-making.
2. Visualizing Data: Using Google Looker Studio, create interactive dashboards to improve data presentation and comprehension.
3. Analyzing consumer behavior: highlighting payment trends to help focus marketing efforts.

# Prerequisites: 
You should have the following information and resources ready before beginning this project:
1. Fundamental SQL Knowledge: Knowledge of SQL queries like SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, and WHERE and HAVING data filtering. To gain knowledge in building and maintaining relational tables and databases.

2. Fundamental Python Skills: Proficiency in Python and its libraries, including Matplotlib/Seaborn for simple visualizations and Pandas for data manipulation.  Proficiency in managing data frames and carrying out data transformation and cleaning operations.

3. Google Looker Studio: The ability to create interactive dashboards and visualizations with Google Looker Studio, formerly known as Google Data Studio.  · Proficiency in creating dynamic reports and integrating data sources.

4. Concepts of Data Analysis: Gaining an understanding of fundamental data analysis methods, including trend analysis, time period comparison, and data aggregation for insights. Knowledge of measures such as overall revenue, growth percentages, and performance standards.

5. Technologies & Tools: SQL Database: A database that uses SQL to store and retrieve data. Python: An environment or compiler (like Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook) for executing Python programs. One way to create and share dashboards is with Google Looker Studio, which requires a Google account.

The project uses SQL queries and process it with Python for cleaning and enrichment. Calculated features like qty_growth and delta_2022_2021 to measure performance trends.

# Visualization and Analysis
1. Analysis of Top Products (2022):
   o Determined the top five products in the "Mobiles & Tablets" category based on sales volume using SQL and Python.
   o Using Python packages like Matplotlib and Seaborn, results were shown as bar charts.

2. Category Trend Analysis (2021 vs. 2022):
   o Examined the growth or drop in sales by category in 2021 and 2022.
   o Determined the Top 20 products with the biggest drop in sales by concentrating on the "Others" category. For side-by-side comparison, horizontal bar charts were created.

3. Payment Behavior of Customers:
   o Found clients who finished the checkout procedure (is_gross = 1) but still owed money.  To enable focused follow-ups, consumer categories were created.

4. Dashboards for Google Looker Studio:
   o Created and released interactive dashboards to showcase important discoveries.
   o Looker Studio was used to integrate the data and display: ▪ Sales performance by category year over year. ▪ Declining trends and high-performing items. Payment trends and past-due payments from customers.
   o To improve decision-making, these dashboards provide data exploration, dynamic filtering, and simple sharing with stakeholders.
   
# Technologies and Tools Utilized
1. SQL: construction, querying, and aggregation of databases.  Used advanced filtering, JOIN, and GROUP BY to extract data.
2. Python: Pandas data processing for transformation and cleansing.  Matplotlib and Seaborn visualization for in-depth understanding.
3. Google Looker Studio: Developed dynamic dashboards with drill-down functionality and real-time filters. SQL-based data was integrated for stakeholder sharing and visualization.

# Key Deliverables
1. Actionable Insights: Top products and revenue-generating categories were identified. Draw attention to patterns and irregularities for targeted promotions and inventory optimization.
2. Interactive Dashboards: Google Looker Studio dashboards allow for real-time data examination.  Stakeholders can easily navigate the visualizations.
3. Suggestions for Customer Targeting: Optimized cash flow and sales conversions by identifying clients for payment follow-ups.

# Outcome
By providing stakeholders with interactive visualizations and actionable insights, the initiative supports strategic choices in customer management, sales, and marketing.  Dashboards from Google Looker Studio facilitate data accessibility and interpretation, promoting data-driven strategies for improved corporate results.
